// Variables - These are named memory location for data
    	// Tpo create a variable in javascript we use the keyword let... Example:


        let message; // this statement creats a variable with the name message
        message = "Hello world"; //the message variable stores the string 'hello worlld'
        alert(message);

        let fName = 'Joe', age = 32, msg = 'Hello'

        //Rules for declaring variables;
            //1. Always start with the key word
            //2. Never declare two variables using the same name
            // The name must contain only letters, digits or the symbols $ and _
            //3. Always start with alphabet characters
            //4. Don't use numbers to name ur variables
            //5. After declaring a variables don't 4get to terminate(;)
            //6. After initializing a variable don't 4get to terminate(;)
            //7. When the name contains multiple words always use camelCase ie firstName
            //8. Case matters name and Name are two diffrent variables. Always ensure to check on your casing
            //9. Avoid using reserver or key word eg let
            //10. If you want to have a variable that does not change, declare the variable using the keyword const ie cont pi = 3.142


            //Summery
            //We can declare variables to store data by using the var, let or const keywords.
            //let - is a modern variable declaration
            //var - is an old-school variable declaration. Normally we don't use it at all
            //const - is like let but now the value of the variable can't be changed anymore
            //Variables should be named in a way that allows us to easlly understand what's inside them.


            //Task
            //declare two variables: admin and name.
            //Assign values to the declared variables
            //reassign the value to both variables
            //Show the values of the two variables using alert(must outlut the assigned values)


            let admin = 'Josee';

            let name = 'Novestus';

            alert(admin);
            alert(name);
